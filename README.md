## Python course by Corey Schafer

This is a re-visit of [Corey Schafer's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g "Corey Schafer") Python Course on YouTube.

This iteration of the course will utilize Jupyter Notebooks to facilitate
anotations and observations alongside the code.

My intention is to explore each section to a greater depth and to show
experimentational and additional code examples.
